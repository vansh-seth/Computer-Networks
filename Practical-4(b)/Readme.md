# Study of Various Networking and Inter-Networking Devices

## Objective
The objective of this study is to understand the functionality and usage of different networking and inter-networking devices, particularly **Repeaters** and **Routers**. The study includes designing a network using these devices and simulating it using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## Task to be Performed
1. Study the following networking and inter-networking devices:
   - **Repeater**
   - **Router**
2. Design a network incorporating these devices.
3. Simulate the network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## Networking Devices Overview

### 1. Repeater
- A **Repeater** is a network device used to **regenerate and amplify signals** to extend the transmission distance.
- Operates at **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)** of the OSI Model.
- Used to eliminate signal attenuation over long distances.

### 2. Router
- A **Router** is an inter-networking device that **forwards data packets** between computer networks.
- Operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI Model.
- Uses **IP addresses** to determine the best path for forwarding packets.
- Enables communication between **different subnets and networks**.

## Network Design
The network topology will consist of:
- **Two separate LANs** connected via a router.
- **A repeater** used to extend the signal within a LAN.
- **End devices (PCs, laptops, or servers)** connected to each network.
- **Switches** used to connect multiple devices within a LAN.

## Simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer
1. **Launch Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. **Add the required devices**:
   - Repeater
   - Router
   - Switches
   - End devices (PCs)
3. **Connect devices** using appropriate cables:
   - Use **Copper Straight-through cables** for different devices.
   - Use **Copper Crossover cables** for similar devices.
4. **Assign IP addresses** to each end device and configure the router.
5. **Test connectivity** using **ping commands** to verify communication between networks.

## Expected Outcome
- The **repeater** should successfully regenerate signals for extended transmission.
- The **router** should enable communication between different networks.
- The **ping test** should show successful packet transmission between devices.

## Tools Required
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Basic knowledge of networking concepts**

## Conclusion
This study provides an understanding of **how networking devices function** in a network. By using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, we can simulate real-world network designs, visualize data flow, and troubleshoot potential networking issues effectively.
