# Study and Simulation of Different Network Topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer
## Objective
The objective of this project is to study and simulate different network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer. The topologies covered include:
- Star (using Hub and Switch)
- Mesh
- Bus
- Ring
- Hybrid

## Task to be Performed
1. **Study the Different Network Topologies:**
   - Understand the structure, advantages, and disadvantages of each topology.
   - Learn about their real-world applications and use cases.

2. **Draw the Network Topologies in Cisco Packet Tracer:**
   - Use appropriate networking devices such as hubs, switches, routers, and PCs.
   - Connect the devices according to each topology's structure.

3. **Simulate and Analyze Network Performance:**
   - Configure IP addresses and connectivity settings.
   - Use the simulation mode in Cisco Packet Tracer to observe data packet flow.
   - Identify possible network issues and improvements.

## Network Topologies Overview
### 1. Star Topology (Using Hub and Switch)
- Centralized network where all nodes are connected to a central device (Hub or Switch).
- Easy to troubleshoot and manage but dependent on the central device.

### 2. Mesh Topology
- Each node is connected to every other node, ensuring high redundancy.
- Provides excellent fault tolerance but is costly due to excessive cabling.

### 3. Bus Topology
- All nodes are connected to a single central cable.
- Cost-effective but has a single point of failure and performance issues in large networks.

### 4. Ring Topology
- Devices are connected in a circular manner.
- Data flows in one or both directions with minimal packet collision.
- Failure in one node can disrupt the entire network unless a dual-ring setup is used.

### 5. Hybrid Topology
- Combination of two or more topologies.
- Flexible and scalable but can be complex to design and maintain.

## Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version recommended)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Computers or virtual machines for simulation

## Steps to Run the Simulation
1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Create a new project and select the required networking devices.
3. Connect the devices as per the selected topology.
4. Assign IP addresses and configure device settings.
5. Use the simulation mode to observe data packet movement.
6. Analyze network performance and troubleshoot any issues.

## Conclusion
This project helps in understanding different network topologies and their real-world applications through hands-on simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer. By observing packet flow and network behavior, we gain insights into how different network structures perform in various scenarios.
