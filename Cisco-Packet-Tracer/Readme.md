# Cisco Packet Tracer - Networking and Inter-Networking Devices

## Overview
This lab focuses on using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and understand the behavior of networking and inter-networking devices such as routers, switches, hubs, PCs, and laptops. The goal is to create network topologies, configure devices, and observe the flow of messages within a network.


## Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Network
1. Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Add the following devices to the workspace:
   - **1 Router**
   - **1 Switch**
   - **1 Hub**
   - **2 PCs**
   - **1 Laptop**
3. Connect the devices using appropriate cables:
   - Use a **crossover cable** between similar devices (e.g., PC-to-PC).
   - Use a **straight-through cable** for devices like Router-to-Switch or Switch-to-PC.

### 2. Configuring Devices
1. Assign IP addresses to the PCs and laptops.
2. Set up the router and switch configurations for proper communication.

### 3. Testing Communication
- **Using a Switch**: Send messages between devices connected to the switch and observe successful packet delivery.
- **Using a Hub**: Send messages between devices connected to the hub and observe packet collisions or broadcasting behavior.

## Output
- **Message Transmission via Switch**:
  - Packets are directed only to the intended recipient, demonstrating efficient communication.
- **Message Transmission via Hub**:
  - Packets are broadcasted to all connected devices, showcasing the limitations of a hub in handling network traffic.
  
Screenshots of successful configurations and packet transmissions should be included in this section.

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrates the fundamental differences between switches and hubs in a network:
- **Switches**: Provide efficient communication by directing packets to specific devices.
- **Hubs**: Broadcast packets to all devices, leading to potential collisions.

The hands-on exercise using Cisco Packet Tracer reinforces the concepts of network design and helps in understanding the role of inter-networking devices in efficient data communication.
