# Transmission Media 
## Overview  
This document summarizes the key concepts from the article on **Transmission Media and its Types** by PyNet Labs. Transmission media refer to the physical pathways that connect devices and enable data communication. These media can be broadly categorized into guided and unguided types, each with distinct characteristics and applications.

## Types of Transmission Media  
### 1. **Guided Media**  
   - **Definition**: Data signals are transmitted through a physical medium like cables.  
   - **Types**:  
     - **Twisted Pair Cable**: Commonly used for LANs, it consists of pairs of wires twisted together to reduce interference.  
     - **Coaxial Cable**: Features a central conductor surrounded by insulation and shielding, used for cable TV and internet.  
     - **Fiber Optic Cable**: Uses light signals for data transmission, offering high speed and minimal signal loss.  

### 2. **Unguided Media**  
   - **Definition**: Transmits data without a physical medium, relying on wireless communication.  
   - **Types**:  
     - **Radio Waves**: Used in broadcasting, mobile phones, and wireless networks.  
     - **Microwaves**: Suitable for long-distance communication via satellite links.  
     - **Infrared**: Utilized in remote controls and short-range communication.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing Transmission Media  
Selecting the right transmission media depends on:  
- **Bandwidth**: Higher bandwidth supports faster data transfer.  
- **Distance**: Longer distances may require media like fiber optics to minimize signal loss.  
- **Interference**: Environments prone to electromagnetic interference (EMI) benefit from shielded cables or fiber optics.  
- **Cost**: The budget determines whether a cost-effective or premium solution is feasible.  
- **Scalability**: Media should support future expansion needs.
